### Source Code

<p><br /><font face="Verdana" size="2">The friendly folks at Microsoft were kind enough to provide us with a great set of sample vb.net code. I'd highly recommend any .Net developer - especially the beginner/intermediate guys - to download the samples and work through them. They contain a wealth of knowledge. <br /><br />
The relevant samples page can be found at:<br />

The samples included range from the extreme beginner to fairly advanced, and covers concepts like Serialization, GDI+, XP Theme support, ADO, Thread pooling, etc, etc.<br />
